* What you plan to measure to achieve your educational goal and address your problem
* ——1. Since there are various educational platforms that have different features, I need to find the most appropriate one for my current project.
* ——2. I need to get access of their data.
* ——3. I will read related articles, in order to get better sense of all possible features that I should pay attention to when I analyse the data.
* ——4. I will test the features and the model that is built based on thoes features.
    * **Including an fake data set**
    * I have not made a final decision about which platform I will use. At the current stage, I'm using the edX as a reference. Therefore, the features in this fake data set are based on the edX and will be refined later.
Good luck!
